# OpenUUP

> [!NOTE]
> All development for OpenUUP happens on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/charles25565/openuup). Pushes on Codeberg automatically sync to GitHub, but not vice versa.

Simple container image that lets you self-host the open source parts of UUP dump as well as a basic frontend.

A live demo is [here](https://openuup.onrender.com/).
